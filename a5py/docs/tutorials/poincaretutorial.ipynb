    "# Generating Poincaré plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to generate Poincaré plots, a.k.a. puncture plots, with ASCOT5. These plots are generated by tracing markers and recording their position each time a marker crosses a poloidal or toroidal plane. They are mainly used to visualize magnetic field structures and particle resonances. Poincare plots can be made for both field lines and particles.\n",

    "For a Poincaré simulation it is necessary to have a dedicated marker and options input. The easiest way to generate these is to run the script found at `a5py/preprocessing/poincare.py`. The arguments are printed if no arguments are given when running the script.\n",

    "ntrace is the total number of markers to be simulated and these are initially distributed radially evenly between the interval \\[rhomin, rhomax\\]. Note that if the magnetic field is poorly normalized (there is a \"hole\" in rho data on the axis when plotted in GUI) this initialization might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**tor0, pol0**  \n",
    "Initial toroidal and poloidal angle \\[deg\\] for the markers. If negative, markers are randomly distributed. Usual habit is to initialize markers at the outer mid-plane (pol0 = 0) and randomly in toroidal direction (tor0 = -1).\n",

    "**rhoend**  \n",

    "Maximum CPU time limit for simulating a single marker. Usually it is not necessary to set this value. However, field line tracing uses adaptive time step (so does the particle tracing but this can be changed manually to the fixed step scheme) and so the simulation might get \"stuck\" if the field has poor quality.\n",

    "Marker pitch. Relevant for when particles are simulated. For field lines this only controls if markers are traced along (1) or opposite (-1) to the field lines. *Note that you will need to change this parameter for particle simulations as the pitch equal to unity (default value) is not acceptable.*\n",

    "Setting this parameter turns the initialized markers from field line tracers to actual particles which are simulated with the adaptive guiding center mode (it is possible to do gyro-orbit simulation but this has to be changed afterwards in the options).
