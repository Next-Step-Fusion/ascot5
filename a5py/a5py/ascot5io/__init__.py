class Ascot5IO(RootNode):
    """Entry node for accessing data in the HDF5 file.

    Initializing this node builds rest of the tree. This object and its child
    nodes act as container objects for the data in the HDF5 file. At top level
    (this node) run nodes containing simulation results can be accessed as well
    as the parent nodes (bfield, efield, etc.) that in turn contain the actual
    input groups.

    The data can be accessed as

    .. code-block:: python

       data.bfield.B_2DS_1234567890

    or, equivalently,

    .. code-block:: python

       data["bfield"]["B_2DS_1234567890"]

    In each input group, one input is always set as "active" (meaning it would
    be used for the next simulation) and it can be accessed as

    .. code-block:: python

       data.bfield.active

    QID can be used as a reference as well

    .. code-block:: python

       data.bfield.q1234567890

    Run groups are accessed in a similar fashion, e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

       data.run_1234567890 .

    However, the easiest way to access the simulation output is via the methods
    in the RunNode. The active run (by default the most recent simulation) can
    be accessed with

    .. code-block:: python

       data.active

    and its inputs as

    .. code-block:: python

       data.active.bfield

    Most of these examples also work with dictionary-like reference but here we
    use only the attribute-like referencing for brevity.

    You can even use user defined tag taken from description to refer to it

    .. code-block:: python

       data.THATPRLRUN

    However, there are few rules to this:

    - Tag is the first word in description converted to all caps for brevity.
    - Maximum length is ten characters.
    - Only letters and numbers are allowed (all special characters are removed).
    - First character must be a letter.
    - If two fields would have identical tags, they are changed to format
      <tag>_<i>, where i is running index starting from zero (corresponding
      to most recent data).

    Finally, you can print the contents of a node with

    .. code-block:: python
